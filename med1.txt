How the web works
The World Wide Web, often referred to as the web, is a system of interconnected documents and resources that are accessible over the internet.
 It works through a combination of technologies and protocols that allow users to access and interact with web content.
Client and Server: The web operates on a client-server model. Users (clients) access web content and services stored on remote computers (servers) via web browsers,
 mobile apps, or other client software.
URLs (Uniform Resource Locators): To access a specific web resource, you typically enter a URL in your web browser. A URL is a string that specifies the address and protocol to be used for retrieving the resource. 
For example, "https://www.example.com" is a URL.
HTTP and HTTPS: When you enter a URL, your browser uses either the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) or the more secure HTTPS (HTTP Secure) to request the resource from the server. 
HTTPS encrypts data transmission to protect your privacy.
DNS (Domain Name System): To translate human-readable domain names (e.g., www.example.com) into IP addresses, your browser queries a DNS server. 
This step is crucial because it helps your browser find the server hosting the requested web content.
Request and Response: Once the browser knows the IP address of the server, it sends an HTTP request to that server for the desired resource.
 The request typically includes details like the type of content required (e.g., HTML page, image, video) and other information.
Server Processing: The server processes the request and retrieves the requested resource. 
It might generate dynamic content or fetch data from a database, depending on the nature of the request.
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: Web content is often composed of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for structuring the page,
 CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling it, and JavaScript for adding interactivity. 
These technologies work together to create the web page you see in your browser.

To become a web developer, you'll need a combination of education, skills, and practical experience.
 Here are the key requirements and steps to become a web developer:
Educational Background:

While a formal degree is not always required, many web developers have a bachelor's degree in computer science, web development, 
or a related field. However, it's possible to learn web development through self-study and online resources.
Technical Skills:

Proficiency in web development languages and technologies is essential. You should be comfortable with:
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): For creating the structure and content of web pages.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): For styling and layout of web pages.
JavaScript: For adding interactivity and functionality to websites.
Understanding of web development frameworks and libraries such as React, Angular, or Vue.js.
Familiarity with server-side languages like PHP, Python, Ruby, or Node.js, as well as databases like MySQL or MongoDB.
Knowledge of version control systems like Git.
Proficiency in using web development tools and editors (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
Front-End Development:

Front-end developers focus on the user interface and user experience. 
You should be skilled in creating responsive, visually appealing, and accessible web pages.
Back-End Development:

Back-end developers work on the server-side of web applications. You should understand how to build and maintain server infrastructure,
 handle databases, and develop server-side logic.
Web Development Frameworks:

Learn popular web development frameworks and libraries, such as React, Angular, or Node.js, depending on your chosen specialization.
Databases:

Understand how to work with databases to store and retrieve data. SQL and NoSQL databases are commonly used in web development.
Web APIs:

Learn how to work with web APIs to integrate third-party services or build your own.
